# ひらがな　-- Hiragana

- One of three にほんご writing systems.
- Enables you to read.
- Prerequisite for most beginner にほんご textbooks and resources.
- A good place to start.
- No writings: no need to learn how to handwrite it right of the bat.
  - Little payoff even if you learn to do it.
- Relatively simple.
- Image-based mnemonics are a perfect method for memorization (see "[Mnemonics and Worksheets](#mnemonics-and-worksheets) section below").

> - Struggle (with accomplishment) tells your brain that this is a thing worth remembering.

No need to print it out necessarily!
