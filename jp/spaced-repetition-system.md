# Spaced Repetition System

- Acronym: SRS.
- A learning technique based on flashcards.
- Develop a stronger memory when you recall something right before you forget it.
- Review your flashcards at the most efficient moment possible.

## How it works:

0. Pick a Card.
1. You get it correct, the interval between now and the next review will get longer.
2. You get it wrong, the interval gets shorter.

## Available SRS Options

- [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/).
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
- [iKnow](https://iknow.jp/content/japanese).
- [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/en/learn-japanese).
