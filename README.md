### Hi there 👋

I’m a software engineer who loves cutting-edge tech and lives in learning mode—then turning around to teach what I’ve learned. I’m self-motivated, disciplined, and organized, and I take real ownership of my work. I question the status quo, experiment, and keep moving forward—so if you want to explore a new “dungeon,” I’m the person you can trust to go with you.

- My current objectsives are:
  - [ ] Learning Deutsch 🇩🇪.
  - [ ] Learning how to develop a fault-tolerant microservice architecture.
  - [ ] Designing orthogonal, loosely coupled systems (this is applicable to also how I code).
  - [ ] Focusing on backend development.
  - [ ] Incorporating AI agents and chatbots while I code.
- 💬 Ask me about JS/TS, Python, Docker, Linux, NodeJS, and microservices.
- 🧑‍💻 Basically this is my beloved stack:
  - 🐘 PostgreSQL, 🌱 MongoDB.
  - NestJS.
  - 🐍 Python, JavaScript/Typescript.
  - 🐳 Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD.
  - Linux.
