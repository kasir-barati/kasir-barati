### Hi there 👋

A Fullstack dev with love for cutting edge technologies and on his journey to learn and teach. Having a can-do attitude and being industrious gave me the courage to question the status quo. I take ownership for what I do like when I decided to teach my brother HTML/CSS. A self-motivated, self-disciplined, and self-organized nerd with big ideas.

Curious like a cat, and that’s why you can trust in me when you wanna explore a new dungeon :)A Fullstack dev with love for cutting edge technologies and on his journey to learn and teach.
